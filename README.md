My name is Chi, a software engineer with stong interests in AI and data analytics!
I love helping people solve problems. 

I have a Master's of Artificial Intelligence degree in Data Engineering, and a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering.
After working as a bio-pharmarceutical technical serivices engineer for 2 years, I stumbled upon coding through Data Science and Engineering, and haven't looked back since!

I enjoy solving riddles and playing number games in my free time.
